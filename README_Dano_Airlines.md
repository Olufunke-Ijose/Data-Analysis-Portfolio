## ðŸ“Œ Objective
Review the satisfaction ratings, and additional information about passengers of Dano Airlines and recommend a data-driven strategy to increase the Airline's customer satisfaction rate.

## ðŸ“Š Tools
- Power BI
- KPIs and combo charts
- Filters by overall rating, gender, age-group, class and travel-type

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights
- Top 3 highest rated services:
	- in-flight service
	- baggage handling
	- seat comfort
- Overall rating is influenced by departure/arrival delays. The lower average departure/arrival delay aptly got ratings of 5 and 4, except for rating 1 which was significantly given by the Economy Class passengers.
- Business Class has the most satisfied customers, also the class with the highest customer count.
- Economy Class has a slightly lower customer count than Business, however, the number of dissatisfied/neutral customers is quite significant. The Airline should strategize on how to appeal to this group of customers.
